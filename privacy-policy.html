        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">ATA Forms Trainer &mdash; Effective February 20, 2026</p>

        <p>4th Degree Labs, LLC ("we", "our", "us") built the ATA Forms Trainer app. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the app.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>The ATA Forms Trainer stores study progress data &mdash; including quiz scores, flashcard review history, and study streaks &mdash; locally on your device using an on-device SQLite database. This data never leaves your device.</p>
        <p>We do not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or any other data that could be used to identify you.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The app currently requires no special runtime permissions. A future update may request microphone access to enable optional voice commands for hands-free form practice. If introduced, microphone access will only be used for on-device voice recognition and will be entirely optional.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The app does not use any third-party services. There are no analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking tools of any kind.</p>

        <h2>Internet and Data Transmission</h2>
        <p>The ATA Forms Trainer is a fully offline application. It does not connect to the internet and no data is transmitted from your device.</p>

        <h2>User Accounts</h2>
        <p>The app does not require or support user accounts. No registration or login is needed to use the app.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since the app does not collect any personal information from any user, there is no risk of inadvertently collecting data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has somehow provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>All app data is stored locally on your device. Your data persists until you uninstall the app or clear the app's storage through your device settings. We have no access to your data and cannot retrieve or delete it on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be communicated through app update release notes. We encourage you to review this page periodically. The effective date at the top of this page indicates when the policy was last revised.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:fourthdegreelabs@gmail.com">fourthdegreelabs@gmail.com</a>.</p>
